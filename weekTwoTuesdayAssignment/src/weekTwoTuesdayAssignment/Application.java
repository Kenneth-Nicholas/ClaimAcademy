// Assignment 
// Create classes for:
// 1) Library
// 2) Book
// 3) Branch
// 4) Customer
//
// Add fields and methods to represent these object e.g.,  A book object might have fields :
// private String author;
// private int isbn;
// private String title;
// private int numberOfPages;
//
// A library would have a collection of books;
//
// Create a Library Object with method to count the total amount of books in the library.
// Create a method to get the branch the library is associated with.
// Create a method to add new customer's to the list of customer for a particular library.
//
// Your program should be able to print out a customer's name and all the books, checked out under their names. 



// Questions:
// If I add a book, do I have to create a new array? 
// So do I need an expand method to create a new book array, 
// copy the contents of the old book array over,
// and expand the new book array by one to hold the new book?
//
// Same question regarding adding a new customer,
// and adding a new staff member.
// 
// If I have a private object as an instance variable, how can I access it?
// 
// How can I initialize a private object that is an instance variable of another object
// by going through the object's instance variable?
